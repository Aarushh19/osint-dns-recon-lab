# OSINT and DNS Reconnaissance Lab (Information Gathering)

This project demonstrates open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques and DNS reconnaissance to gather public information about domains, historical web snapshots, and exposed documents using publicly accessible tools. Conducted as part of a cybersecurity lab at the University of Central Florida.

---

## üéØ Objective

To develop hands-on experience in reconnaissance and footprinting techniques by:
- Investigating domain ownership and infrastructure
- Locating sensitive public documents through Google hacking
- Exploring archived websites via the Wayback Machine
- Scanning networks and resolving DNS entries

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- `whois` command (domain registration lookup)
- Google Dorking (`filetype`, `inurl`, `site:`)
- Wayback Machine (web.archive.org)
- Nmap with `--script vuln`
- DNS reconnaissance (hostnames, subdomains, name servers)

---

## üîç Key Activities

1. **WHOIS Enumeration**
   - Gathered registrar, contact, and DNS information for domains like `brighthouse.com`.

2. **Google Hacking**
   - Used operators like `site:ece.ucf.edu filetype:doc ssn` to find sensitive files.

3. **Wayback Machine Lookup**
   - Searched for historical snapshots of `ucf.edu` and found information on past leadership and events.

4. **DNS Scanning**
   - Used `nmap --script vuln` to identify potential CVEs and open ports in simulated networks.
